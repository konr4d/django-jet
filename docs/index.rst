License
=======

Django JET (which Django JET2 is based on) has two kinds of licenses: open-source (AGPLv3) and commercial. Please note that using AGPLv3
code in your programs make them AGPL compatible too. So if you don't want to comply with that we can provide you
a commercial license (visit Home page). The commercial license is designed for using Django JET in commercial products
and applications without the provisions of the AGPLv3.
